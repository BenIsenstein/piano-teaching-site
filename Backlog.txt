June 16:
- fix redirect behaviour on image upload
- add forms and inputs to the color scheme module
- build addStudentForm across the entire stack



-  when a user logs out, assess if they're still authorized to be on their current page, or be redirected. √

Add auth check inside the useEffect() in UserHomepage. Right now anyone can visit any user's account √

Devise a method to book lessons with familes/students. Lightweight Calendar/Messaging API?
- This will ensure kids can't add infinite lessons, polluting their account

Semantically change MenuOnLeft.
